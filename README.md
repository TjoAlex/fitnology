### Icons
+ In order to keep an uncluttered site only a few icons were utilized when needed to keep things simple for the user. 
### Color Schema

   - The main colors used in this site are black(#111), white(#ffff), gray(#777), and teal(#0c343d).
   - Main text color is Black #111
   - Intro sections for home page have text color gray #777
   - Buttons, logo and navbar text carries this teal color #0c343d, for some contrast and theme color.
