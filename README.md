### My strategy 

I started the whole project by finding knowledge and inspiration from the code institute follow along project named Boutique Ado to get a brief understanding of how to make a project like this. You will find a link to this project in the credits section. I also had another website in mind whilst doing this application, this named Fitbit, in which I have found most of my inspiration regarding the layout of the website and itâ€™s system. In case anything has been copied from another code all information about that will be found under the credits section. Yet in terms of my process all in which was created by inspiration from already working platforms. (maybe edit this)
